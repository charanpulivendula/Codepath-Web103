## Notes

- One of the challenges encountered was ensuring that the images loaded correctly and consistently across different screen sizes. This was solved by using `object-fit: cover` to maintain the aspect ratio and by adding placeholders while the images load.
- PicoCSS integration was smooth and greatly enhanced the visual appeal of the app without adding much overhead.
